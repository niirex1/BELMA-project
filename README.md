# BELMF: Blockchain-Enhanced Language Model Framework for Smart Contract Security

## Introduction

The security of smart contracts is a paramount concern in the blockchain ecosystem. Traditional methods often rely on either formal verification or machine learning techniques, each with its own set of limitations. 

## About BELMF

We introduce **BELMF**, a comprehensive framework that synergistically combines formal verification methods and large language models like GPT-3 for smart contract vulnerability detection and repair. 

### Formal Verification Methods

BELMF employs formal verification techniques such as model checking and symbolic execution to rigorously identify a wide range of vulnerabilities, including reentrancy, integer overflow, and unauthorized access.

### Large Language Models

The framework utilizes transformer-based large language models, fine-tuned for bias and error mitigation, to provide reliable and automated vulnerability repair suggestions.

## Evaluation

BELMF has been rigorously evaluated across multiple blockchain platforms including Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and EOS. It outperforms baseline methods in key metrics such as accuracy, network load, data privacy, and cost-benefit trade-offs.
